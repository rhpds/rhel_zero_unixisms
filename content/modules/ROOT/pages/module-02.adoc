=== What is the ~ directory?

Linux is filled with shortcuts, and learning these shortcuts is a crucial step to speeding up your work. 
One such shortcut is the tilde `~`

The tilde `~` is aliased to the current user’s home directory. To test
out some applications of this, change directories to the root directory
of the system:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
cd /
----

The `~` alias works in any case where you have to specify a path. If you
wanted to list the contents of the _.ssh_ subdirectory located
in the home directory of *root*, the following command is valid:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
ls ~/.ssh/
----

NOTE: This is another place where you can practice tab completion.
Typing `ls ~/.ss` and then pressing tab will complete the path for you
since there is nothing else in *root*’s home directory starting with
`.ss`.

This means that running `cd ~` will always change directories to the
home directory of the user that you are logged in as.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
cd ~
----

You will see that your current directory has changed from

to

NOTE: The `cd` command contains yet another shortcut, where running
`cd` without any arguments will behave the same as running `cd ~`.

Print the full path to the directory you are currently in, the `~`
directory, using the ``print working directory'' command:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
pwd
----

This shows that `~` is equivalent to `/root`, the home directory for the
*root* user. Try the same test for a different user account on this
system, *rhel*.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
su - rhel
----

Adding the `-` after `su` will automatically change directories into the
*rhel* user’s home directory, so print the full directory again:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
pwd
----

You can see that when logged in as *rhel*, `~` is equivalent to
`/home/rhel`, which is the *rhel* user’s home directory.

NOTE: The *root* user home directory is in a unique location, `/root`.
All other users’ home directories will be located following the
convention `/home/<username>`, as in the case of the *rhel* user’s home
directory.

To switch back to the *root* user for the next steps of the lab, type `exit` into the command line, or use the keyboard shortcut by pressing the "ctrl + d" keys at the same time.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
exit
----
