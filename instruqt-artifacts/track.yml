title: Unusual Unixisms [Admin 101]
description: |
  # Overview:
  New users coming from a different operating system can be confused by certain quirks that are common across Unix-based operating systems. Being exposed to these ahead of time means that you are less likely to have to discover them through time-consuming troubleshooting sessions, and some commands used in this lab will prove to be useful tools in your system administration toolbox.

  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be aware of a few conventions that often trip up Unix beginners.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Accessing documentation using `man`
  * Using tab completion to save keystrokes and improve accuracy
  * Learning the meaning of `~`
  * Accessing hidden files
  * Running commands as __root__ vs. __sudo__
  * Interpreting epoch time
